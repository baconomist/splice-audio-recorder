- ignore accnts that havent updated their jobs within a year, we want mostly co-op students that frequently update their linkedin
- maybe only look at uni students


- correlate importance of work experience/potfolios/GPA


example of a gpa on linkedin: in bio + under waterloo (DOES NOT SHOW IN PDF prolly cus its custom text so u have to scrape for anything containing "gpa")
